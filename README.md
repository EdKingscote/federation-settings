# Federation Settings
[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gitpod-ready--to--code-blue?logo=gitpod)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fedtools/federation-defaults)

A collection of federation defaults for optimal handling of R&E federation aggregates and trust models.


**Missing settings for your federation?**

Contact your federation operator via  their [eduGAIN contact](https://technical.edugain.org/status). Request them to update their records here. 
This can be done by forking the repo, creating the appropriate ALL CAPS edugain shortname directory and prefixed files (prefix also all CAPS) within the new directory and once tested, submitting a pull request for inclusion. Contributors should include evidence of a configuration  being successfully processed in their pull request.
